# WebX - Multithreaded Web Proxy

## Overview
WebX is a high-performance multithreaded web proxy that implements key operating system concepts such as **sockets, multithreading, process scheduling, thread synchronization, and memory management.** It is designed for efficiency and scalability while handling multiple client requests.

## Features (Updated ✅)
- ✅ **Basic client-server connection established using sockets.**  
- ✅ **Thread pool implemented** for handling multiple client requests efficiently.  
- ✅ **LRU caching mechanism** to store frequently accessed web pages.  
- ✅ **Proxy server now supports real websites!**  
- ✅ **Successfully handles HTTP requests and forwards them to the intended destination.**  
- ✅ **Correctly parses and retrieves web pages from external servers.**  
- ✅ **Finalized fixed project structure.**  
- ✅ **Client successfully connected and received response from server.**  
- ✅ **Future implementation: Enhanced caching and HTTPS support.**  

## Compilation & Execution (Updated ✅)
```sh
make
./bin/webx   # Run the server
./bin/client # Run the client

## Simple Test (Updated ✅)

# Start the server
./bin/webx

# Test with cURL as a client
curl -x http://localhost:8080 http://example.com
