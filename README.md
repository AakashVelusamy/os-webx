# WebX - Multithreaded Web Proxy

### Overview
WebX is a high-performance multithreaded web proxy that implements key operating system concepts such as **sockets, multithreading, process scheduling, thread synchronization, and memory management.** It is designed for efficiency and scalability while handling multiple client requests.

### Features (Updated âœ…)
- âœ… **Finalized fixed project structure.**  
- âœ… **Basic client-server connection established using sockets.**  
- âœ… **Thread pool implemented** for handling multiple client requests efficiently.  
- âœ… **LRU caching mechanism** to store frequently accessed web pages.  
- âœ… **Proxy server now supports real websites!**  
- âœ… **Successfully handles HTTP requests and forwards them to the intended destination.**  
- âœ… **Correctly parses and retrieves web pages from external servers.**  

### Compilation & Execution (Updated âœ…)
```sh
make
./bin/webx   # Run the server
./bin/client # Run the client
```
### Simple Test (Updated âœ…)
```
# Start the server
./bin/webx

# Test with cURL as a client
curl -x http://localhost:8080 http://example.com
